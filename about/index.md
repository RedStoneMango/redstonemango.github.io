# Hi! I'm **RedStoneMango**

I am a German Java developer, and occasional over-engineer of tiny tools. I enjoy building useful things from scratch and exploring the finer points of system scripting and application design.

---

## Stats

- **Languages**: Java, CSS, Python, Bash
- **Build Tools**: Maven, Gradle
- **IDEs**: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code
- **Frameworks**: Java AWT / Swing, JavaFX
- **OS**: Fedora Linux

I work mostly in Linux environments and build both desktop applications and command-line utilities.

## Toolbox

I’m a big fan of JetBrains IDEs—especially **IntelliJ IDEA**—since I mainly develop in Java using Maven and Gradle.  

As a Fedora Linux user, I’m also deeply into Bash scripting, and for that I often use **VS Code** due to its flexibility and lightweight nature.

This combination helps me stay productive across both desktop applications and command-line tools.

## Development Philosophy

My coding approach usually starts before I even write a line of code. I spend time thinking through the entire application while on the bus or train, so by the time I sit down to work, I already know about 90% of what I want to build.

When coding, I focus heavily on **simplicity**—I prefer using modern language features like streams and array operations instead of manual loops, even if that ties me to newer language versions.  

I’m not shy about over-engineering projects for the fun of it, even if I don’t always need those complexities myself. But the biggest lesson I’ve learned is this: **less code is almost always more code.** Writing less often means better efficiency, clearer app flow, and improved readability.

My motivation is always the end result. Even when debugging bugs or frustrating issues, I remind myself why I’m building something and keep pushing—_pun intended_.

I constantly strive to learn new ways to solve problems. Sometimes I look back at code I wrote just weeks ago and wonder how I solved certain problems so oddly! This is because I’m always evolving my thinking, often inspired by conversations with developers from different languages and backgrounds. One quote that nicely summarizes this is from Socrates:
> *"He who thinks he is something has ceased to become anything."*

It reminds me to stay humble, keep improving, and always question my old solutions.
